# High-Res-Observed-Budget
 Data files and code used in the calculation of a high-resolution observed sea ice concentration budget in the Arctic's Last Ice Area. This is part of a dissertation in part fulfilment of the MSci Environmental Geoscience degree, written by Gillian Cheong.

 ## High-resolution sea ice concentration budget analysis in the Arcticâ€™s Last Ice Area
 ### Overview
 This repository contains the data files and code needed to run the high-resolution sea ice conncentration budget analysis over the Arctic's Last Ice Area. The data processing and budget calculation is adapted minimally from previous code by Dr Harry Heorton. 

 Example data presented in this repository is for 18-24 March 2020. The full dataset and accompanying code is also running on the server on /home/gch/MSci_Submission

 There are two custom modules written by Dr Harry Heorton, and an executable Jupyter Notebook. The modules and notebook are used in the following steps:
 #### 1. Import and process data into Jupyter
   #### Key features
    - Data formats are in raw format, with no preprocessing, smoothing or regridding needed beforehand. 
    - Capable of computing daily and monthly budget.
    - Can accomodate gaps in data.


 ### 2. Module 1: Budget inputs

 This module contains the code required to access input data on the Jupyter Notebook. Each type of input data has its own class, which enables the script to decide which data it needs to access and when to access it. The input data class is used to access the code.


 ### 3. Module 2: Budget calculation

 This module contains the custom functions used in the code. It contains the smoothing function, as well as functions to calculate the intensification, advection and divergence terms of the observed budget. The main Jupyter Notebook then derives the residual term by subtracting advection and divergence from intensification.


 ### 4. Plot data
   #### Key features
    - Timeseries of decomposed budget
    - Map composites combining sea ice drift vectors and budget components


 ### 5. Calculate volume estimates of budget components
   #### Key features
    - Mask data to constrain to regions of convergence only. This mask can be altered as you wish.
